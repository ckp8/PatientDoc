# PatientDoc

The project brief required us to design and develop a web application of our choice. The app was required to carry out CRUD functionality (create,read,update, and delete data). We were required to use Flask micro framework to develop this application, and required to use MySQL to store data. I have 2 tables sharing a one to many relationship.
